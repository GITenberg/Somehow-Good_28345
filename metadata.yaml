description: In a remarkable series of events, a nameless man strikes up a friendship
  with a young woman and while with her loses his memory from an electric shock. She
  takes him to her mother's house where her mother realizes the man is the husband
  who left her twenty years earlier. As the title implies, there is a happy ending
  to this charming story.
